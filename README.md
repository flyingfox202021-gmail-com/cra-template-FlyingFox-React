# FlyingFox-React

This is a ReactJS BoilerPlate with a custom design for use within Flying-Fox applications. Feel free to use within personal projects
and raise any issues or PRs to improve on this.

## Overview

The main starting script moves away from react-scripts to a custom webpack configuration which is optimised for production builds.

To start the application in development mode, please run this command:

NPM Start

Webpack is also handles the build for pre-release and release. To create the build folder, please run this command:

NPM run build
